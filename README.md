# Beijing_Weather
Remote Weather Visualization: 

I would like to know the weather in Beijing and see a visualization. This way I can alert my family and friends about the weather conditions. It should be able to show tomorrow's date and the corresponding weather + temperature. This project looks small and can be placed on a desk.

The project is visualized by a matrix of 8*8 LED pixels with “sunny” and “rainy” icons. Made by p5.js Web Editor and Arduino IDE.
